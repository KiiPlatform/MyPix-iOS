MyPix-iOS
=========

MyPix is a bare-bones sample application that shows you how to create a user account then upload and browse pictures within that account. Pictures are available across devices, and this sample can easily be extended with social layers, sharing, and better UX to become a full-fledged photo application.

MyPix is built on top of [Kii Cloud](http://developer.kii.com) so you don't need to do any backend setup or coding, you can just plug in the easy-to-use Kii SDK and you're up and running!

#### KiiToolkit
MyPix also utilizes the open-source [KiiToolkit](https://github.com/KiiPlatform/KiiToolkit-iOS) library for even faster development. This provides a tableview, imageview and login view that plug directly into Kii Cloud - allowing us to create this entire app in a single class with around 100 lines of code!

## Getting Started
If you want to get up and running quickly, simply:

* Check out the code
* Plug in your [Kii Cloud](http://developer.kii.com) App ID and App Key to the method `beginWithID:andKey:` in **AppDelegate.m**
  * _To get an App ID and App Key, see: [Registering your App on the Kii Developer Portal](http://documentation.kii.com/en/starts/ios/) (it's free!)_
* Build & run!

## Next Steps

This is a great way to get your new photo app up and running even faster with [Kii Cloud](http://developer.kii.com), so have fun building, feel free to contribute and let us know what you think!
